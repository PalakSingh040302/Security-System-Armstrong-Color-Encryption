# Security System using Armstrong Numbers and Color-Coded Encryption

This project is a Python-based security system that employs Armstrong numbers and color-coded encryption for secure and real-time validation.

## Key Components

### Armstrong Numbers
An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Color-Coded Encryption
Adds an extra layer of security by using colors as part of the encryption process.
